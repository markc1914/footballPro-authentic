# Xcode automatically generates this directory with a hierarchical structure of Swift package dependencies
# that mirrors the structure of a project using a package. Because this directory is generated automatically,
# it is recommended to add it to your .gitignore file.

# Code Injection
#
# After new calculation method was introduced in Xcode 14,
# having a hierarchically sorted list of files may require
# having each group sorted in Xcode manually when:
# - using non-default sorting
# - restoring contents for "xcuserdata" directories
# Otherwise, you may experience random diff noise when:
# - adding or removing files
# - switching branches
# This file can still remain in git if you want to persist data like
# breakpoints or UI state between sessions.
